Urban City had the most total drivers which had an impact on the average fare per ride and average fer per driver.  
Rural city had the least drivers but had the highest average fare per driver.

THe three city types begin to peak at mid-febraruary and then they start to go down in march except for the urban that lasts through april.


## Summary

My recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types would be:
Include distance data to compare fare per ride rates between urban and rural city types.
